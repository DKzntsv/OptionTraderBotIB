This is a repository with the source code for the Algorithmic Trading Bot that trades Options using InterectiveBrokers(IB) API. 
------------------------------------
1) IDEA: The Bot uses Black-Schoels Model to asses the fair price of the option at a particular frequency. Then it should make trades based on the "fair" value and the current price. 
2) REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
   1. OptionsTraderIB.py - main programm with everything
   2. samples - Samples for the IB API code 
   3. tests - Tests
